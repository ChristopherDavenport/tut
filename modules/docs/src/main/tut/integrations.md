### Integration with sbt-microsites

The [sbt-microsites plugin](https://47deg.github.io/sbt-microsites/) uses **tut** and **sbt-site** and some other odds and ends to turn your documentation into a really nice little website. It is entirely excellent and I recommend it highly.

### Integration with sbt-site

If you wish to use **tut**  with [sbt-site](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-site) add the following to `project/plugins.sbt` in your project to add SBT shell commands:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-site" % "0.8.1")
```

Then in your build sbt, link the files generated by tut to your site generation:

```scala
project("name").settings(site.addMappingsToSiteDir(tut, "tut"))
```

When the `makeSite` task is run in sbt, the typechecked tutorials from `src/main/tut` will be incorporated with the site generated by sbt-site in `target/site`.
